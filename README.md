# Real-Time Object Detection with OpenCV

🚀 This project demonstrates **real-time object detection** using **OpenCV** and a pre-trained **MobileNetSSD model**.  
It detects common objects like people, cars, chairs, dogs, etc., directly from your webcam feed.

## 📌 Features
- Real-time object detection with OpenCV
- Uses MobileNetSSD pre-trained model
- Supports multiple object classes
- Easy to run with Python

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaikshandu/Real-Time-Object-Detection-With-OpenCV.git
   cd Real-Time-Object-Detection-With-OpenCV/opencv
Install dependencies:
pip install opencv-python
▶️ Usage
Run the following command:
python real_time_object_detection.py --prototxt MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt --model MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel
This will start the webcam and perform real-time object detection.

👉 You just need to save this as **`README.md`** in your repo’s root folder.  
👉 Since you already have `real_time_output_gif/demo-gif.gif`, GitHub will display it automatically.  

Would you like me to also add a **requirements.txt** (so anyone can install all dependencies in one command)?
